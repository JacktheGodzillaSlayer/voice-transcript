 Well, tensions are rising between President Trump and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. In a social media post today, Trump called Zelensky a dictator without elections. Zelensky was elected president in 2019 after a career in entertainment. However, due to the war, Ukraine did not hold elections that were scheduled for April of 2024. Today's post came after Zelensky accused Trump of living in a Russian disinformation bubble earlier in the day. The exchange comes at a crucial time for Ukraine, which is struggling to lock in western support for its fight against Russia's invasion.
